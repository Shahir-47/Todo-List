## pages

The `pages` folder is responsible for rendering different pages based on user demand within the application. It contains the code necessary to generate and manage the rendering of various pages, each serving a specific purpose. This README provides an overview of the structure and functionality of the `pages` folder.

### Folder Structure

The `pages` folder includes the following files:

- `all.js`: This file is responsible for displaying all the todo items, filtering them based on user requirements, and sorting them according to the selected sorting option. It also handles the animation effects for deleting, editing, completing, and marking items as important. Additionally, it renders each todo item stored in the list and communicates with `project.js` to update the todo item object when buttons like delete, edit, or star are pressed.

- `homePages.js`: This file generates pages such as Today, Week, Important, and Completed. It displays the todo items due today, this week, items marked as important, and completed todo items, respectively. The `homePages.js` file is responsible for rendering the relevant tasks and providing a clear overview based on different timeframes and priorities.

- `indivProj.js`: This file generates the todo task list specific to a selected project. When a user clicks on a project, `indivProj.js` is responsible for displaying all the tasks associated with that project. It enables users to view and manage tasks within a project context, improving organization and task management.

- `notesUI.js`: This file generates the Notes and Starred Notes pages and displays all the notes. It handles buttons associated with individual notes, such as starring or deleting a note. `notesUI.js` provides a dedicated space for users to create, view, and manage their notes effectively.

- `projectUI.js`: This file generates the All Projects and Starred Projects pages, displaying all the projects. It handles buttons associated with individual project items, such as starring, deleting, or editing a project. `projectUI.js` allows users to create, organize, and modify their projects conveniently.
