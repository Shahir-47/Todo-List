## src

The `src` (Source) folder contains the source code for the project. It includes various folders and files that are responsible for generating and styling the application's pages and components. This README provides an overview of the contents and structure of the `Src` folder.

### Folder Structure

The `src` folder is organized as follows:

- `assets` Folder: Contains all the icons used in the project. These icons enhance the visual appeal and contribute to a cohesive design.

- `css` Folder: Contains the stylesheets that define the visual presentation of the application. The CSS files in this folder provide styling rules for different pages and components.

- `functions` Folder: Includes the core JavaScript functionality required for dynamically generating content and handling various actions in the application.

- `pages` Folder: Contains all the files used to render a page for the user to view.

- `index.js`: The main controller of the webpage, responsible for managing event listeners and determining which pages to display. It handles actions such as showing all tasks, displaying today's tasks when clicked, filtering based on the search bar input, toggling light mode based on the switch, and more.
